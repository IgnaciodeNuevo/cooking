            <p>I'm Ignacio Villanueva and I work as a <em>frontend developer</em>.</p>

            <p>While my main skills are in frontend performance, responsive design, web typography, and accessibility, my mindset is that of a designer. I craft delightful products and interfaces with an eye for user experience, who puts the user's needs first.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™m best when working as a nexus between design and frontend.</p>

            <p>I learn from the community and love to share what I have learned and give back. I write articles and talk at events. I also spend some time mentoring people, so if you think I can help you, don't hesitate to tell me.</p>

            <p>Host of <a class="link link--special" href="http://wecodesignpodcast.com">WeCodeSign</a>, a <em>weekly podcast</em> about frontend, UX and web design. Coâ€‘founded <a class="link link--special" href="http://frontfest.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FrontFest.es</a> (one the biggest <em>conferences about frontend</em> development in Spain) and also coâ€‘founded <a class="link link--special" href="https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-Weekends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Weekends</a>, a monthly Open Source Meetup. ðŸ˜Š</p>

            <p>When not creating websites, I love to spend my time learning about typography, going to cooking courses or playing basketball with friends.</p>
